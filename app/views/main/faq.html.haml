          What is the Veracity Project?
        #FAQ1.collapse
          %p The Veracity Project is the ongoing project in which we select individual initiatives, each one located in a different part of the world, that we believe will help the local community in a significant, tangible, and sustainable way. For each initiative, we will prepare a video and explanation as to what the community needs and how we plan to help. We will optimize our social media platforms to bring awareness to these initiatives in an effort to inspire others to make a small donation and share our message with their social media platforms. After we've completed an initiative, we will circle back with our donors so they can see "first-hand via video" how their donation made a significant impact on others. Our belief is that small contributions from a large number of people will help create substantive change in communities around the world.

          Why was the name “Veracity Project” chosen?
        #FAQ2.collapse
          %p When we decided to move forward with this project, we challenged each other to identify three values that would guide us through the duration of the project. Although we all chose different words to represent those values, there was a commonality in our theme – we all committed to being honest, transparent, and dependable (to each other and our donors). We felt veracity encompassed this sentiment.

          Who is involved in the Veracity Project?
        #FAQ3.collapse
          %p The Veracity Project is made up of volunteers who believe in making a tangible positive social impact in an affordable, transparent way. We are a community of traveling remote professionals with varied backgrounds and skills who are committed to giving back to each community that welcomed us so graciously. We knew we would need help making significant impacts in short periods of time, so we opened up the opportunity to help communities over the world to our altruistic family and friends back at home.

        %a{ :role => "button", "data-toggle" => "collapse", :href => "#FAQ4", "aria-expanded" => "false", "aria-controls" => "FAQ4"}
          How are individual initiatives selected?
        #FAQ4.collapse
          %p We take pride in each initiative we select, so we do an extensive  amount of research before committing to a given plan. Since we are only living in each city for one month, we are sure to something that we can complete in that timeframe. We conduct research online and connect with city locals before arriving in each city so once we arrive in a city, we are already hard at work for the community.
          %p Some of the criteria we rely on include: 
          %ul
            %li Well-defined and tangible result(s)
            %li Significant impact on the local community
            %li The ability to be accomplished in one month
            %li Sustainability
            %li The need for us to get our hands dirty (we’re not just a fundraising mechanism)
            %li The capacity to track our monetary spend (so we can share with our donors)
            %li Clear communication with our local liaisons (so nothing gets lost in translation)
      %li
        %a{ :role => "button", "data-toggle" => "collapse", :href => "#FAQ5", "aria-expanded" => "false", "aria-controls" => "FAQ5"}
          How often are new initiatives selected?
        #FAQ5.collapse
          %p We are currently traveling to a new location each month. Our plan is to select a new initiative in every location, assuming we identify a clear, tangible, sustainable way that we can make a significant impact in a relatively short amount of time during the month we are living in that specific location.

          How is Veracity Project different from other charitable giving projects and organizations?
        #FAQ6.collapse
          %p One of the best things about Veracity Project is that everyone involved is a 100% unpaid volunteer – eliminating the large (+8%) administrative overhead skimmed off the top of your donations by most charities and crowd-funding solutions. 
          %p Another big difference about the Veracity Project is each member is committed to doing charitable work with or without donations. That being said, we realized many people want to help, but feel either they can’t afford it or don’t fully trust how their donation will be spent. We acknowledge both these things, and provide a platform for you to donate as much or as little as you would like (even skipping one cup of coffee one week and donating that dollar amount to one of our initiatives will help tremendously). You will receive an itemized list of where each dollar raised has been spent. Plus, if you have any questions, we’re always happy to hear from you!

          How and when can I see how my donation was spent?
        #FAQ7.collapse
          %p In less than a month after our campaign, we will show you exactly what we were able to accomplish by combining our hard work with the funds generously donated. At the end of each initiative, we will share the total funds raised and a breakdown that explains how the money was spent. In the rare situation that we raise much more than needed for our planned work in a given community, we will donate all remaining funds to either the host charity for the initiative or an organization that will continue the support we were providing.

        %a{ :role => "button", "data-toggle" => "collapse", :href => "#FAQ8", "aria-expanded" => "false", "aria-controls" => "FAQ8"}
          How can I find out more about a past initiative?
        #FAQ8.collapse
          %p Please take a look at our Initiatives section to see more about our past, current, and future initiatives. We will share updates on our success at the completion of each project, so you can see for yourself what we raised, what we accomplished, and how it helped (or will continue to help) the local community. For additional follow-up information about a specific initiative, please email us at info@veracityproject.com.

          How can I help (in addition to donating)?
        #FAQ9.collapse
          %p Although a donation (no matter how small) is most helpful, there are other ways to help as well. Please share our website, Instagram account, and Facebook page with your friends and family to help us raise awareness and extend our reach. The more people we reach, the better.
